## What's new

We’re excited to announce a significant update to the ALM AI Widget! Here are the key enhancements:

-   State Machine for Improved User Experience: We’ve implemented a state machine to enhance user interactions. Now, when one user is actively using the AI service, other users will receive an alert indicating a busy server. This ensures that the flow of the first user remains uninterrupted.

-   Quality Filtering with Results Rating Requirements: Our “Check Quality” tool has been enhanced. It now includes results rating requirements based on the following enums:
    -   Great
    -   Good
    -   Acceptable
